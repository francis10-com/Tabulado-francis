                    <b>Self-Advocacy: </b>
For me, self advocacy begins with the intentional choice to remain open in a world that often rewards cynicism. I advocate for my own well being by protecting my spirit and choosing to lead with warmth, even when I feel tired or overwhelmed. I’ve learned that I have the right to seek out spaces that fuel my soul and to walk away from environments that demand I harden my heart. By advocating for my own friendliness, I am essentially protecting the best version of myself so that I have the energy to give back to others.

                <p>
                    <b>Individual Advocacy: </b>
                   When I see someone standing on the fringes the person quiet in the corner or the colleague eating alone I see an opportunity for individual advocacy. To me, this means using my voice to ensure no one feels invisible. I make it my mission to be the bridge, pulling people into the circle and validating their presence with a genuine smile or a seat at the table. It’s not just about being nice it’s about standing beside someone and saying, I see you, you belong here, and I will make sure others see that, too.

                <p>
                    <b>Systems Advocacy: </b>
  I believe we need to overhaul the systems that pit us against one another. My systems advocacy is a call to move away from every man for himself and toward a culture of collective camaraderie. I dream of workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods where the rules are built on cooperation rather than cutthroat competition. I advocate for communal spaces, shared goals, and policies that prioritize human connection over pure productivity, because I know that a community bonded by friendship is far stronger and more resilient than a group of strangers.
